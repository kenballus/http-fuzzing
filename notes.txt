field-content is the thing on the rhs of the : in an http header field.
It's defined to be (basically) r"field_vchar (\w+ field_vchar)?"
field_vchar is defined to be (basically) r"[printable ascii character]"
So does that mean we can only have at most 2 characters, separated by one or more spaces???
This actually gets fixed in RFC 9110, (which is very modern) so I would expect that many servers have implemented this pretty weirdly.

You can't have whitespace between the header field and the colon. This has caused security issues in the past. Look into what those are, and maybe we can use them.

google accepts HTTP/1. and HTTP/1.9999999999999999, but not everybody does.
It seems like the number of digits people are willing to accept in an HTTP version number, and whether they'll accept versions that don't exist, varies.

If I send two of the same header, what happens?
What if it's two of the same header, but with different capitalization?

Microsoft ASP.NET uses some weird shit that involves a server called IIS that just forwards everything to another server called Kestrel. Might be worth looking into that.
