userinfo is allowed to be empty.
    i.e. the following is a valid URI:
        scheme://@dartmouth.edu

reg-name is alllowed to be empty.
    i.e. the following is a valid URI:
        scheme://

port can be any number of digits.
    i.e. the following are valid URIs:
        scheme://dartmouth.edu:
        scheme://dartmouth.edu:1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111

HEXDIG cannot be lowercase. This probably has consequences in many more RFCs than just this one.

The whole "scheme://" thing is actually just one of four options. In truth, "scheme:" is a totally valid URI because of path-empty. An authority is a totally optional part of a URI.
